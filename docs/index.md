# Command Line Options

By Ross Smith

_[GitHub repository](https://github.com/CaptainCrowbar/rs-options)_

## Overview

```c++
#include "rs-options.hpp"
namespace RS::Option;
```

This is my command line option parsing library.

This uses my [formatting library](https://github.com/CaptainCrowbar/rs-format),
[PCRE2 C++ wrapper](https://github.com/CaptainCrowbar/rs-regex),
and [unit test library](https://github.com/CaptainCrowbar/rs-unit-test).
The unit test library is not required if you only want to use this library
without building its unit tests.
