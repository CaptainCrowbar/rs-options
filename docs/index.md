# Command Line Options

By Ross Smith

_[GitHub repository](https://github.com/CaptainCrowbar/rs-options)_

## Overview

```c++
#include "rs-options.hpp"
namespace RS::Options;
```

This is my command line option parsing library.

This uses my [formatting](https://github.com/CaptainCrowbar/rs-format) and
[unit test](https://github.com/CaptainCrowbar/rs-unit-test) libraries. Both of
these are header-only libraries; the unit test library is not required if you
only want to use this library without building its unit tests.
